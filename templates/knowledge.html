    <h3 style="margin-top:8px; font-size:15px;">History of Blockchain</h3>
    <p style="font-size:13px; line-height:1.6;">
      Blockchain technology began with the publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and the subsequent launch of the Bitcoin network in 2009.
      Bitcoin introduced a tamper-evident, distributed ledger that solved the double-spend problem without a central authority. Over time, researchers and developers extended those ideas
      to permissioned ledgers, improved consensus mechanisms, and richer data models. Today blockchain underpins applications ranging from cryptocurrencies to decentralized finance and distributed registries.

    <h3 style="margin-top:8px; font-size:15px;">History of Smart Contracts</h3>
    <p style="font-size:13px; line-height:1.6;">
      The concept of "smart contracts" predates blockchain; computer scientist Nick Szabo described the idea in the 1990s as self-executing agreements codified in software.
      Practical, widely-used smart contracts became possible with platforms such as Ethereum (launched in 2015), which provided a Turing-complete virtual machine and developer tooling
      to write composable on-chain logic. This allowed programmable assets, automated escrow, decentralized exchanges, and a broad ecosystem of decentralized applications.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:8px; font-size:15px;">Why this matters</h3>
    <p style="font-size:13px; line-height:1.6;">
      Together, blockchain and smart contracts enable trust-minimized coordination, transparent record-keeping, and automated enforcement of rules. These properties make them useful
      for financial infrastructure, supply-chain tracking, identity systems, and many kinds of automation that benefit from verifiability and decentralization.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:12px; font-size:13px; line-height:1.6;">
      Scientists and engineers like Ajmal Adamz are working today to apply blockchain technology and smart contracts to build practical tools and services that help ordinary people — improving access, security, and transparency in everyday applications.
